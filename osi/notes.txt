7. Applications 
- End user layer (what user see)
- Http, Ftp, IRC, SSH, DNS
6. Presentation Layer 
- Syntax Layer
- Encryption and Decryption (Data Conversion, Encryption, and Compression)
- SSL, SSH, IMAP, FTP, MPEG, JPEG, Mp4, AVI 
5. Session
- Synch & Send sends to port 
- API's, Socket, WinSock 
- Establishes connection (add session to data)

4. Transport 
- End to End Connections
- TCP, UDP
- PDU: Segments

3. Network 
- PDU: Packets
- IP, ICMP, IPSec, IGMP
2. Data Link
- PDU: Frames
- Ethernet, PPP, Switch, Bridge
- responsible for transferring information on the same network by using/reading the mac address
- turns packets received from the network layer into frames
- responsible for error control and flow to ensure successful transmission
- Framing 
    - adds the header(IP address) and trailer  (Error control is achieved by adding a calculated value CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check)) to the bits (data) from physical layer
- http://www.highteck.net/EN/DataLink/Data_Link_Layer.html
- Typical frame header fields include:
    Start Frame field - Indicates the beginning of the frame
    Source and Destination address fields - Indicates the source and destination nodes on the media
    Priority/Quality of Service field - Indicates a particular type of communication service for processing
    Type field - Indicates the upper layer service contained in the frame
    Logical connection control field - Used to establish a logical connection between nodes
    Physical link control field - Used to establish the media link
    Flow control field - Used to start and stop traffic over the media
Congestion control field - Indicates congestion in the media
1. Pysical
- Physical Structure
- Coax, Fiber, Wireless, Hubs, Repeaters
- Topologies Bus, Star, Ring, and Mesh
- Communication modes/Data Transmission such as Simplex, Half Duplex, and Full Duplex
